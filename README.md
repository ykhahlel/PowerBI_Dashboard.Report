# PowerBI_Dashboard.Report
In this short project i created a report for a coffee shop using powerBi. My focus was was on excersing the report layout,understanding various layouts and interactions in order to tell a story.
This report clearly shows the profits the coffee shop made vs the budge that was allocated for each specific region.For clear understanding i also made use of adding a symmetry sharing
it automatically shares the graph into 2 triangles indicating which part is leaning towards budget and which partis leaning towards the actual profit.
